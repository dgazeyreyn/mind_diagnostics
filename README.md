# Impact of Website Visitor Traffic on User Signups

## Background

Mind Diagnostics (MD) is a mental health startup that allows users to take mental health tests online. It's free to use, no sign-up is required, and the confidential results are delivered immediately.

MD have a large amount of anonymized meta-data on their users and were looking to understand what factors, if any, increase (or decrease) the chances that a given user will sign up for their tele-therapy offering.

The original project scope consisted of an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Specifically, identifying relationships between User Signups and Visitor Browser, Visitor Operating System, and Visitor State. Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) and Data Cleansing processes were essential steps towards EDA.

The project scope was subsequently expanded to quantify relationships via Multivariate Logistic Regression.

The Jupyter Notebook contained within contains the results of this analysis.
